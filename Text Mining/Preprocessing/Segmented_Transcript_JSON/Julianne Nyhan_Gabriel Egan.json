    "utterance": "\nMy very earliest memory is from sometime in the 1970s and computers were in films and on television. I\u2019m the youngest of eight children and my elder siblings were mostly technologically mad and excited by computers especially. There were three boys older than me in my family. That\u2019s where I saw computers.\n\nThe first actual hands-on encounter was when I took Computer Science, as it used to be, when there were still O-levelsFootnote1 in the late 1970s. We had a Teletype machine with an acoustic coupler and a modem. You would call up the local polytechnic and when you got the connect tone you put the handset into this fur-lined box, which connected the Teletype to the mainframe. You would write your programs in BASIC and this was an interactive service. Before that it had all been batch-wise. That is, you wrote your program on a form and it was mailed to the computer centre at the polytechnic. It was run and you were sent the results as a paper printout. So it was a new leap forward to have Teletype as an interactive service and I used that throughout my O-level.\n\nAnd then, my O-level Physics teacher at school got hold of an Acorn System 1, a micro-processor kit, and he and his A-level studentsFootnote2 had to build the kit. They lost interest once they built it and it worked and it switched on. I wanted to do the programming and I learnt assembly language programing from the handbook that came with this little \u00a380 kit. It was a single 6502 microprocessor with a full 1 k of RAM and I taught myself programming that way.\n\nThen I went through the usual 1980s route of having a Sinclair Spectrum and Commodore 64 computer. I left school at 16 and did a TOPS (Training Opportunities Scheme) training course, which was a way of getting commercial training for young people in the early 1980s. I took a TOPS course in Computer Operating, so I ended up at the age of 17 as a Mainframe Computer Operator, which in those days really was about staying up all night and changing the tapes whenever the machine wanted a new tape at 330 am. Someone had to be there to put the correct tape up on the machine or to put the right deck of punch cards in to the hopper. It was still clunky punch cards, huge disc packs and exchangeable discs. The discs were old fashioned. You see them in the films, they look like a big washing machine someone lifts the lid, puts a disc pack in, closes the lid down, and that\u2019s another 70 MB of storage the machine\u2019s got.\n\nSo I worked as a Mainframe Computer Operator from 1982 to 1988 and by the end of the decade I could see this job disappearing. It was very clear that microprocessors were going to be taking over from mainframe operations. Large rooms full of servers that don\u2019t need much physical attention were taking over the old-fashioned mainframes that had exchangeable discs and tapes. I tried to get into helpdesk operations, into the more customer-orientated side of the work, but by the late 1980s I figured I\u2019d actually chosen the wrong career all together. So, I went back to school and got my A-levels, and then just carried on with a BA, MA, PhD and didn\u2019t stop for 9 years. Luckily I was funded all the way through, and came out, at the age of 32 with a PhD. But for all that time I was interested in computer applications for the work I was doing on literary texts.\n",

It would be something like, you know, all the traffic lights now in Reading are controlled by this new computer centre and there\u2019d be a picture of a room full of white boxes with flashing lights and people very smartly dressed.\n\nIn fact, I showed some slides on this to a group recently that got a huge laugh out of it. I was showing them adverts from the 1970s for why you should buy the new Honeywell or the new ICL computer. There was a picture of a new computer room, beautifully clean and white, with very smartly dressed people, usually women, who would be moving between the machines and doing the work. And then I cut to an actual picture that I\u2019d taken of the computer room that I worked in, which, of course, was extremely dirty and full of very scruffy people. It was overcrowded \u2013 in the advert the room was large and had white spaces between the boxes. There was the central processor here and 10 ft away was the disc drive, and it was all spacious and clean and white, it looked like a Scandinavian home. But cut to the computer rooms I worked in, which were basements, overcrowded with monitors and lots and lots of scraps of paper and dirt and boxes of pizza, and there\u2019s a large disjunction between the public perception of a computer room and the reality. I found this out quite early in my first job at the age of 17.\n",

But I got this thing second-hand for \u00a350 and it was just for taking a day\u2019s worth of notes. When I worked on books I found other people would annotate the margins of the books and I never did that. I\u2019d have the book open, I\u2019d take notes and I\u2019d type into the computer. I still have those notes, I mean I still have everything I ever did for my BA in the early 1990s, because I kept no paper. I was paperless from the start. Well, the only paper I had was books. Back then, you still had to have the books. But I kept none of my own files on paper.\n\nWhat I found about 7 or 8 years ago was that I could actually transfer all my existing books to computer as well. So I digitised all of my several thousand books and destroyed them in the process, but that was okay. So it was possible, even then, to do all your BA all electronically.\n\nI found exams were part of my assessment requirements for the BA, and I did the first year exams writing by hand. But I do actually have a hand injury and I really can\u2019t write for very long. I had done very well in my essays but I did very poorly in the 3 hour exam and I asked if in future I could do my exam on a computer because of this disability. The university agreed and my grades shot up. I had no advantage \u2013 there wasn\u2019t even a spell check or anything. It was just a basic text editor. So it wasn\u2019t that I started Humanities and then applied the digital to it. They started simultaneously for me and I didn\u2019t think it was feasible to do a degree if it couldn\u2019t all be computerized.\n\nI think I\u2019ve had a phobia against paper right from the start. It\u2019s a diabolically bad medium for storing human knowledge in my view and I say that as a book historian. I\u2019m used to that technological revolution, the Gutenberg revolution, and our revolution. The bit in-between doesn\u2019t much interest me.\n",

We read for the content mainly. And I say this as I actually teach students how to print on a sixteenth century hand press. The medium does shape but you\u2019ve always got to remember that it\u2019s not about the medium. The printers of Shakespeare\u2019s time didn\u2019t want to impose themselves upon the works. When they did their jobs to the best of their ability they disappeared from the picture. You don\u2019t feel you\u2019re reading a book when it\u2019s working properly. I think Book History is taking a detour into an intellectual dead-end where people think that the making of a book is somehow a collaborative act involving not only the author but the scribe and the compositor and the publisher and everyone else. I think, ideally, when that system works properly, everyone gets out of the way of the author essentially.\n\nWhat we really want is a totally transparent medium. Digital is much better for that than paper. Right now, I\u2019m looking at a piece of paper on the table.

Or I may need to hear it, in digital I can just listen to the text being read. So, I\u2019ve got a bit of a bee in my bonnet about the limitations of the printed book.

And to my horror, in 5 years\u2019 time they weren\u2019t all doing this. In fact, even now, it is not common to go to a lecture hall, in my area at least, English Studies, and find students using laptops. They will be sitting there, with their phones in their hands, they may be updating their Facebook status or texting each other, but they are not using computers as a tool for their learning very much. Which really surprised me, because I figured I was 5 years ahead of the curve. But I was 20 years ahead. Compared to my contemporaries, yeah, I used computers much more than anybody else.\n\nSome made it quite clear they felt they resented the intrusion of computers into English Studies, some people still do actually, there is still a bit of that about. But I was just ahead of my fellow students and doing things like going into the library to find out what digital resources they had. My fellow students didn\u2019t know that in 1989 the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was published for the first time on CD-ROM, so you could search for words by their meaning, which is the first time you could ever do that. Or that you could find indexes of the contents of journal articles that were available as databases, actually on CD-ROMS back then. So yeah, I was ahead of my fellow students just for that reason.\n\nI had a friend called Peter White when I was doing my Master\u2019s degree in Stratford-Upon-Avon. White had bought with him his printed concordance to Shakespeare. I had my digital text of, well, the Oxford edition digitised and my big desktop computer. We got into big debate, in front of other people, about the relative merits of the printed concordance and the computer version. He said he could beat me in any search for given words (where does the word \u2018blue\u2019 come within five words of \u2018box\u2019 in Shakespeare) and he raced me. We had a formally adjudicated race, him with the Bartlett concordance and me with my computer. We had to find 10 or 20 things in Shakespeare and come back immediately by saying \u201cthat\u2019s Julius line one, act 2, scene X\u201d. He won. He was very proud of having won but I pointed out to him that this machine I\u2019m sitting here with will be twice as fast next year, and twice as fast again the year after. So, you know, pretty soon I\u2019m going to beat you at this, and obviously the future is that these machines are going to get much, much faster and the printed book isn\u2019t.\n\nThe irony is actually Peter then went on to be ProQuest\u2019s person in charge of EEBO (Early English Books online).Footnote4 He became a digital convert a few years after that. I claim some credit for opening his eyes to the power of the computer in Humanities studies.\n",

She said that when she was doing her undergraduate degree in English at Queen\u2019s University Belfast she noted with disappointment that one by one, in different lecturer\u2019s and tutor\u2019s offices, the computer would appear on the desk. Basically, there had been a desk and papers and a typewriter and suddenly this new device started to appear, in the late 1980s early 1990s. Since then she has herself become an academic expert in the use of computers in Literary Studies and finds others\u2019 Ludditism as annoying as I do.\n\nI think it\u2019s largely because of people\u2019s abilities.

Those things tend to go together; they tend to think of computers as rather soulless beasts. This has all changed in the last, 15 years, 10 years I think, really. But back in the early 1990s, of course, most computers didn\u2019t have graphical user interfaces. They had a command line and green dots of phosphor. They were forbidding, formidable looking beasts; they weren\u2019t the very cuddly, round-edged devices we have now.

Although, I learnt, as I say, machine code programming, which was 0s and 1s, although the short cut was you didn\u2019t have to put in 0s and 1s, you\u2019d use hexadecimals (base 16), but you were still putting in numbers. But, yes, by the 1990s we could have text-based machines. And that was the interesting thing to me these machines could store the very material that I worked on. You could have the poem in there, and what is more, the thing that really grabbed me was I could have all my notes. I was aware there was virtually no chance I could memorise everything I was learning as an undergraduate or a graduate student. I knew if it sat in a cabinet somewhere it would never really get used. There was no way anybody could build a reasonable concordance to my notes, so the point of computerizing everything was that everything I\u2019d ever thought was recoverable by me.

You really can\u2019t go shopping or use the library these days \u2026 and libraries are an important one, actually. Once the library catalogues forced everyone to start using some aspect of computers I think the artsier people thought \u201cI\u2019m not too bad at this. I\u2019m able to use a keyboard and enter a search and get something meaningful back\u201d.\n\nIn English Studies I think it\u2019s the digitisation of the library catalogue that has been the big help. And the other thing is that all the machines just got nicer to use. I remember, when I was an undergraduate, I often used to go to Senate House, in Malet Street, in London, to use the library. I actually saw a very old scholar who was trying to key in an enquiry in to the library catalogue and had obviously no training at all and was told just to go and use it. He knew the thing that he wanted to search for, and he said to me \u201cI can see how to get those letters in, they\u2019re written on the keys, but how do I get the space in between\u201d I said \u201cwell that long bar across the bottom, that\u2019s the space bar.\u201d He had literally never used a keyboard, he\u2019d obviously given anything he wanted to publish to a secretary to type up and he actually had to be told what the spacebar was. But once he was told he said \u201cthere\u2019s nothing written on it, it makes sense that it\u2019s a blank. I see, thank you very much.\u201d And off he went and I\u2019m thinking \u201cwow, imagine getting to the end of your career and encountering the keyboard for the first time!\u201d That\u2019s something you have to use or no-one\u2019s going to do things for you. He also pointed out to me, which I thought was quite an insightful thing, that the letters on the screen do not match those on the keyboard. I said \u201cyes they do\u201d, he replied \u201clook\u201d. He pressed an upper case \u2018A\u2019 on the keyboard and said \u201cthat\u2019s a lower case a on the screen\u201d. I said \u201coh you\u2019re right!\u201d We\u2019ve written on the keyboard itself all the upper case letters but you have to hold the shift key down to get those. The ones that appear on the screen aren\u2019t the same letter \u2018a\u2019 at all, it\u2019s a totally different letter shape.\n",

Let me give you an example of that when I used to work at the Globe Theatre in London. At the Globe it was commonly said, by all sorts of people, that theatre had changed a lot in 400 years. It was said that in Shakespeare\u2019s time people talked about going to hear a play whereas we talk about going to see a play. I started there in 2000 and I thought is that actually true I mean, can we actually just count how often they, in all their different writings from the period, used the different expressions \u2018hear a play\u2019, \u2018heard a play\u2019, \u2018hearing a play\u2019, \u2018hears a play\u2019 versus \u2018sees a play\u2019 \u2018seeing a play\u2019 \u2018saw a play\u2019, \u2018seeing a play\u2019 \n\nSo I went counting, just using Literature Online actually. I needed all the variant parts of speech amidst all the various possible verb-subject constructions, and I just did the counting. It took me a couple of weeks using Literature Online and it turned out that 92\u2009% of the time they would say \u201cgoing to see a play\u201d, exactly like us. They did not say what everyone said they said, which was they would have preferred to go \u2018hear a play\u2019. They do exactly what we do, \u2018we\u2019re gonna go and see a play tonight\u2019, or \u2018I saw a play yesterday\u2019. Actually, Shakespeare was the odd man out, Shakespeare spoke predominantly about hearing a play. So, what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve taken his locution as our norm for the period even though he is, in fact, quite anomalous, he\u2019s in that 8 % minority.\n\nThat was only possible because of Literature Online being available and searchable (this was before EEBO was searchable because of TCP). So I published that piece of work (Egan 2001) that couldn\u2019t be done, other than digitally. I think as a project it would have taken possibly a lifetime to do it on paper.\n\nPersonally, I always think that it can be a limitation of DH if people only focus on the making and they never actually go beyond it. I mean, the TEI is wonderful as it is, yet how many projects do you know out there who really used those TEI-encoded editions to answer a research question There\u2019s a lot of moribund projects as well, things that were made for which no-one actually had a question that needed an answer.\n",

What\u2019s the sort of advice that I gave I was on the JISC e-books project.Footnote7 When the E-Books working group started I was, I think, one of only two academics on it. This is maybe 7 years ago when journal articles had gone digital, by and large. But no-one could see what monographs would do and whether they ought to go digital. So the e-book committee was about looking into that and the only thing I was able to do really, my only expertise was simply I was a Humanist who was ahead of the curve, as it were, because I\u2019d gone digital with everything as soon as possible.\n\nPeople would say things like \u201coh! of course nobody wants to read a book, all of a book on the screen\u201d. I\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019ve been doing so for 15 years. In fact, I haven\u2019t read a book not on the screen for the last 10 years.\u201d Or, they would say \u201cno-one wants a Shakespeare play on the screen\u201d. Actually, this reminds me of back in the early 1990s, for my MA in Shakespeare Studies I wanted to read one of Ben Jonson\u2019s plays like Bartholomew Fair. I found that the Oxford Text ArchiveFootnote8 had a copy, but I had to ask the person who was curating the copy if I could have it. It was somebody called Hugh Craig (see Chap. 3), who I now know through the University of Newcastle, Australia. I emailed him, and he said what \u201cdo you want it for\u201d I said \u201cwell, I want to read it\u201d. And I think he thought I was kidding! I wanted to see the electronic text because I wanted to read the play. I didn\u2019t want to have to go into the library and have to get a book. I wanted to see it on the screen. And then I also knew that if I could have it that way I could search it or if I want to quote it I just copy and paste and it\u2019s quoted and accurate. It astounded him that this was an MA student that was asking for an electronic text because he wanted to read the thing!\n\nThrough committee work it is usually me saying, \u201cno, actually, don\u2019t accept that it is impossible to read for 12 hours a day on a computer\u201d. What I do now is project onto the wall and I don\u2019t look at the glowing screen. It\u2019s much easier on the middle-aged eye ball. But you asked me to reflect, sorry, on the early committee work. I didn\u2019t get into the advising stuff until quite recently. I\u2019ve been a Shakespeare Scholar, I worked at the Globe theatre, and I got a job at Loughborough University. Digital has always been how I\u2019d do it. But I haven\u2019t had that much engagement with many other people, except for the last 5 or 7 years.\n",

We know pretty much the core of the Shakespeare cannon, we know what he wrote, the collected plays edition was published after his death and these are the plays of Shakespeare, all 36 of them. But there\u2019s a few other plays that are probably Shakespeare or partly by Shakespeare. And there\u2019s work being done to explore that boundary, did he, perhaps, write one scene in this other play Or when that play was expanded upon for a revival, did he write the editions For example Thomas Kyds\u2019 play the Spanish Tragedy got expanded at some point in its life and the latest thinking is that Shakespeare wrote the editions to that. You\u2019ve got these extra 500 lines, to make the revised version of the Spanish Tragedy.\n\nI go and listen to papers about this and the papers are highly technical. You need to understand the statistics being used to talk about the significance of certain phrases occurring in Shakespeare and in these unknown author chunks, and not occurring elsewhere. So you can say \u201clook at this word that every so often occurs next to this word in Shakespeare\u2019s known works and in these editions of the Spanish Tragedy but do not occur in all these other peoples\u2019 work\u201d. You can hear peoples\u2019 minds switching off \u2013 Shakespearians aren\u2019t generally very good with the Maths or the technology. So there is a definite reaction against this sort of research. One response is \u201cthat\u2019s all very well but none of my concern\u201d. Another is a kind of panicked rejection because people find it very difficult. Another is a kind of rather cynical response that the digitisation of the Humanities is part of a wider government and business-led instrumentalisation of the Humanities that is trying to drag us out of our academic work or into something that might have some commercial or wider societal impact. In other words, it\u2019s not a neutral or beneficial technology, its actually trying to find out what\u2019s exploitable about the Humanities. So they see it as being the nasty intrusion of business into Humanities.\n\nI think those fears are all unfounded and quite mistaken, but they\u2019re definitely there. The reason I think those fears are mistaken is that Humanists were at the forefront of the last technological revolution that mattered, which was the printing press. Humanists were right there. Thomas More and Erasmus understood the printing press, understood what it would do for textuality and the printing presses were aligned with this great movement of sixteenth century Humanism. So, for me it\u2019s happening again and Humanists need to be at the forefront of technology in the twenty-first century. I\u2019m an old fashioned Marxist, it\u2019s the march of progress, technological progess driving social change in a good way. I mean, I\u2019ve got quite a simple model of progress which is the sort of quaintly old fashioned left-wing idea that the world\u2019s getting better! And this is part of the process, I mean you factor in all the negative aspects as well.\n\nYour lovely digital machine is made by some near slave child worker in China or Taiwan, but factoring that in, that technology is, I think, ultimately liberating. The inherent quality of technology is that it liberates and therefore there is such a thing as human progress. Isn\u2019t that old fashioned of me I happen to think it\u2019s true but that might just be a leap of faith.\n",

I mean, ok, it\u2019s only a digitisation of a microfilm, it\u2019s not the book itself, but they can see what it looked like to its early readers. That\u2019s very important to me. So EEBO and ECCO is a big deal.\n\nBefore that Literature OnlineFootnote10 was a huge deal. We could essentially give everyone all the poetry, prose and plays and they could search them as well. The students could search and, say, research students could come up with their own questions. A friend of mine from Sheffield Hallam University called Matt Steggle told me that he did his entire PhD on questions about how Aristotle figures in early modern writing what is said about Aristotle, how do they think about him So just finding references to Aristotle was a huge project for him. Now, with these resources someone could just pull up all the occasions when Aristotle is mentioned in early print. So EEBO, ECCO and Literature Online, totally changed the whole subject and enabled work to proceed on certain particular things at a much faster rate. There were a bunch of things I couldn\u2019t have done without Literature Online such as that paper \u2018hearing a play, heard a play, saw a play\u2019 that I mentioned.\n\nOED, being online and digital, was a huge transformation. There\u2019s not much beyond that, the subject specific ones haven\u2019t made a big difference. Shakespeare Quartos Archive,Footnote11 I regret to say, hasn\u2019t made much difference. This is a digitisation of all the early quarto printings of Shakespeare at the British Library, the Bodleian, the Folger in Washington DC, [the National Library of Scotland] and the Huntington Library in California. Although I\u2019ve got plans for a project which involves those images, it hasn\u2019t had a great transformatory effect, yet.\n",

    "utterance": "\nYes, certain kinds of stylometric stuff is starting to be and it\u2019s leading to a big debate. Before I move on, I just wanted to mention what we haven\u2019t talked about, namely digital procedures that affect scholarship. Now we have free software, like Zotero, which is great.Footnote12 When I first started doing this with students they had to use EndNote, an awful bit of software. The point is, managing a database of your own references is something I teach research students to do. It transformed my work. I didn\u2019t actually buy bibliographical database software. I wanted to do exactly what I wanted to do, so I programmed my own one. Still the availability of these things makes a lot of difference to scholarship and a big difference to how fast people work.\n\nBack to stylometry etc., those techniques tend to be a bit closed, black-box-type things. In Shakespeare Studies people are looking at tools that will analyse language. They will take a page and categorise each word in it into, say, 100 different categories and say \u201clook! How interesting\u201d or \u201clook how the profile for this comedy is very different from the profile for this tragedy. You know, tragedies have much more words about night time and dark things whereas comedies have lots of words about lightness and happiness etc.\u201d\n\nThe tools are not open, that is one of my bugbears. People are publishing work saying \u201chere is what our tool does\u201d and they don\u2019t tell you how the categories work, they don\u2019t give you the algorithm and they don\u2019t show you the method, which is very dangerous, I think. We all got our fingers burnt with this about 16 years ago when a guy called Donald Foster at Vassar College had a new tool he called SHAXICON, which was doing those kind of analysis of Shakespeare\u2019s writing. He could tell you who\u2019d written what, \u201cthat isn\u2019t by Shakespeare because it doesn\u2019t have his profile\u201d. He never actually said how his profile was worked out, he never gave me the algorithm, never gave me the categories and he always promised the thing was going to be published any day now on the internet. He had huge articles, he had papers in world-class Shakespeare journals (see, for example, Foster 1996), and major newspapers claiming that a computer had solved certain mysteries of authorship but he never published the actual method, how it worked. He still hasn\u2019t, 16 years later.Footnote13\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying as well is that there\u2019s digital work going on but of a very low quality, not because it\u2019s inherently necessarily wrong but because we can\u2019t check it. That makes it low quality. If I can\u2019t validate your results because I haven\u2019t got access to your database or your algorithm then as far as I\u2019m concerned that isn\u2019t scholarship, its vanity publishing.\n",

When I was doing my PhD, I was working on attempts to reconstruct the Globe Theatre, including the one that was being built in London in the mid-1990s. One of the great books that was part of that project was by John Orrell (1983), in which he analysed a contemporary picture of the Globe. From the picture, because of the way the picture was made, with a very precise instrument, he was able to work out the size of the building it was showing. He reconstructed the entire construction of this picture with a thing called a topographical glass, a sort of surveyor\u2019s instrument. When you got to page 80 of his book about this, it was suddenly all equations, 7 and a half pages of trigonometry, it was A-Level trigonometry, which I didn\u2019t have but I wasn\u2019t just going to let this go and not check this.\n\nSo, first of all I went to one of my tutors and said, \u201cyou reviewed this book, didn\u2019t you\u201d, \u201coh yes\u201d, \u201cwhat did you do when you got to page 80 when it\u2019s all Maths\u201d He said, \u201cI just kept turning the pages until it wasn\u2019t Maths anymore.\u201d He didn\u2019t check it. I asked everyone I knew who had read the book and who was a theatre historian. No one had actually checked the maths, which astounded me because they then built this thing on the basis of this calculation, which none of them had actually verified was correct. Luckily, my sister is a maths teacher at A-Level, so she had to teach me the trigonometry, Actually in an appendix to my PhD thesis I take the same measurements and by a totally different trigonometrical method see if I come up with the same result or not as a validation of his method. It took me ages, but I did it, and I remember thinking, \u201cwow these people in my subject just take things on trust, they don\u2019t actually check for themselves that the numbers add up or that the equations are valid and sometimes they\u2019re not, it\u2019s quite extraordinary!\u201d\n",

Funnily enough, I don\u2019t see the new technologies of mobile devices being of any use here; in fact, I\u2019m quite against them. The last thing we needed in the software industry is fragmentation. There\u2019s a great advantage in everyone having the same machine, so you have one piece of software that runs on everyone\u2019s machine. It was bad enough when it was PC versus Mac and 8\u2009% of the market was Mac so software writers had to write another version for the Mac but then to have another one for the Android operating system and another one for iOS \u2013 I think is a very backwards step.\n\nSo we\u2019ve recently seen a real backward step in the power to use the computer prosthetically because the market is fragmenting into four different markets. Apps can\u2019t do anything for us. The smartphones have one advantage over everything else, they know where you are on the surface of the earth and they know which way you are facing because they have a compass built in, sometimes that matters. I don\u2019t yet have a smart phone, I haven\u2019t yet found the need for it.
