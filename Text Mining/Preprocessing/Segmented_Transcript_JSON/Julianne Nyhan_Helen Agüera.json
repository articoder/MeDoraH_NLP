    "utterance": "\nWell, when I joined the NEH in 1979 I had no personal experience with computing technology. I came as a Humanist myself to work at NEH, someone who had done work in Spanish literature and language actually and had never even used any computer-based projects of any kind, or done any kind of that work. At that time computers were large hardware units that were used primarily by businesses for administrative purposes. At the NEH I was introduced to a database of evaluators that the agency was beginning to compile. It was intended to help the programme officers with the reviewers and panellists who assessed NEH applications. And then, shortly after that, the Endowment got its first word processing system to help us create grant documents that had very similar text because changing the address on the letters and other types of documents was repetitious. My only other personal experience in the early 1980s was when IBM PCs became available and I pretty much just did word processing. My first real encounter with the application of digital technology to the Humanities was through the projects that NEH supported.\n\nYou know, I started working in a programme in the \u201cDivision of Research\u201d that supported the preparation of research tools, reference works and scholarly editions. These projects were the ones that were using digital technology at the time. The NEH had been funding some of these projects since the 1970s, primarily, one large text corpus, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG),Footnote1 which began getting funding in the early 1970s. Other projects were using computer technology to generate a print product, and that included dictionaries. We supported many of the dictionaries. But even concordances to texts \u2013 of course, now it is almost unthinkable to think of this as a separate tool \u2013 were considered separate tools at that time. We funded a project to do concordances to the works of Darwin and to the works of William Faulkner, for instance, and then from the output of the computer they created print products.Footnote2\n",

The TLG was a little bit different because it was the only one that really was intended to be used electronically rather than as a printed work that anyone could use in a library, or wherever. So, the TLG as a pure database was obviously was a little different, but, because it had the support of the entire field at the time (it was always well-received) we made many awards to it.\n\nNow, I believe it was probably in 1979, just shortly after I joined NEH, that the programme introduced a separate set of guidelines for projects that involved the use of computers. This had to be a separate statement within the proposal that addressed a number of issues about the use of the computer. The very first question was a justification for using computers; it was so rare, obviously, to use the computer within other fields of the Humanities that you needed to justify why a computer was necessary for the work that you were proposing.Footnote3\n",

People were doing it manually, so the very thought of being able to query the corpus of all those texts, and being able to come out with instances where a word was used was just a tremendous opportunity in the eyes of people from the field (see, for example, Crane 2004).

I remember that because it\u2019s where I met Nancy Ide and Michael Sperberg-McQueen (see Chap. 12) and that made me aware of the importance of coming up with encoding guidelines. That started the opportunity for the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) to apply to NEH for support and we funded the first planning grant to them.

A lot of work was expended doing that yet texts could not be exchanged and reused. So, for the purposes of the review process, that was what persuaded the evaluators at the NEH to go ahead with that kind of support. That was a little bit less tangible to support; after all, you could always think of querying a database and getting results out and that seemed pretty tangible. The development of standards was a little bit outside of the realm of what we normally did. But the Endowment always thought it was important to support tools that were going to facilitate research in the Humanities. In fact, we even did so before computers. An example is the development of a typewriter element for Coptic because there was no way for people to use existing typewriters to create that, so we supported that. That was just an example of things that would seem outside of research tools per se, but they were the tools for the field.\n",

Greg Crane is well known for his promotion of computing technology, first for Classics, but really for the Humanities largely. Early on in the field of lexicography there were some people who promoted use of the technology.\n\nI remember John Nitti who worked on the Dictionary of the Old Spanish Language (see Chap. 9), and he was involved with computer scientists and actually doing the programming. They had to do everything from scratch because mainframes were more in use at the time. Eventually they moved everything to other computers.\n\nIn the context of text encoding I remember Nancy Ide, Susan Hockey (see Chap. 6) and Michael Sperberg-McQueen (see Chap. 12). They were very outspoken in terms of the need to come up with guidelines for encoding text and for ways of archiving material so that it can be reusable.\n\nI also worked a little bit with people in scholarly editions like Peter Shillingsburg and David ChesnuttFootnote5 who were creating scholarly editions in History and in literature. They were working at a time when the use of computers for scholarly editions was not really the main mode of doing editions. They were working with the field and trying to persuade it that there were some things computers could do for scholarly editing.

Accordingly, we started to urge the long-term projects to find ways of sustaining themselves.\n\nSome projects created endowments that would help them meet part of the costs of continually updating. Initially everybody was so excited because you could update this resource easily. But then it became a big burden because you never finish this work, right? At least with a print work, you printed it and were done with the work. In this domain you must continue to update that resource all the time; that requires support and not only in terms of people (the most costly part of it) but also equipment and resources. We managed to urge people; we\u2019d work with them, we\u2019d visit them and we\u2019d talk about some of the funding strategies they could develop to become self-sustaining and not depend on NEH funding forever because it would not be possible for the agency to continue to fund their project in perpetuity.

For instance, we worked with the classical bibliography, L\u2019Ann\u00e9e Philologique Footnote6 for many years to make them understand the need to be self-sustaining.
