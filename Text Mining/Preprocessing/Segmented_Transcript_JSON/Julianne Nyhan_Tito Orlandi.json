I was still at the Gymnasium [secondary school].\n\nThen, early on in my time at the university I became acquainted with Silvio Ceccato. Does that name say anything to you? Probably not, but he was one of the first Italian intellectuals \u2013 and he was Professor at the University of Milan, of course \u2013 to become interested in the Artificial Intelligences or methods to produce artificial reasoning.Footnote2\n\nI was studying Philology at the time and so my Professor of Philology and I tried to arrange a system (this was around 1960) to explore the possibilities of making a critical edition in Latin of St Augustine\u2019s The City of God, with the help of those card computers. I was, in a sense, the originator of the project, because I spoke with my Professor of Philology, Ignazio Cazzaniga, about it. He was curious about those things but he did not know anything about them. I also did not know anything but I had an idea of what it could be. We began to punch cards (I don\u2019t know what has become of them) and then our project finished because I had other things to do. So we tried but we gave up.\n",

Mirella Schaerf, the Director, was very helpful. She was an engineer and she understood my problems and provided a Database Management System (called Omnidata), then running on the UNIVAC mainframe of the centre. She explained how it worked and gave me free access. The staff of the centre were very helpful for some practical things but not for all the rest. The methodological problems I had to try to imagine by myself.\n\nThen I met Luigi Cerofolini and he taught me about the methodological issues and I encountered two things \u2013 that is why I speak of a \u201cturn\u201d. First, I encountered the Turing machine and I had never heard about that before. Second, I encountered Unix. I insist, and nobody in Humanities Computing wants to acknowledge this, but I think that what is most important from the theoretical side is the Turing machine and from the practical side is the Unix system. Cerofolini taught me that Unix is not an operating system, it is an environment system. It is all the ground you have at your disposal when you work.

And, in fact, it gives you the possibility to express your theoretical ideas in a way that is actionable. That is what I happened to like very much about Humanities Computing because in Humanities you can discuss everything and everybody is right. How do you check whether Virgil is a good poet or not? How do you check whether Virgil really wrote that verse or not, and so on. Those discussions have gone on for centuries and everybody is right! Well, I\u2019m not trying to say that everything can be solved in Humanities with computers. But at least you can say \u201chic Rhodus, hic salta\u201d to some questions.

If it is not logically constructed it is intrinsically contradictory and does not stand. That part of Humanities may be automated with enormous consequences in the sense that computers (this is banal but this is where it enters) can manage quantities of memories that the human brain cannot.

Secondly, Busa had no linguistic or semiotic background in a conventional sense and his work was placed far from ongoing computational developments.\n\nThe real beginnings of Humanities Computing can be found in some experiments, especially on artificial translation and automatic translation, which made mistakes, but never mind. Here I\u2019m referring, of course, to the work of William Weaver, Norbert Wiener, and others.

In this context I\u2019m not only referring to experiments here in Italy. Geoffrey Sampson and the British National CorpusFootnote5 and a lot of those enterprises are important too because they went together with Sampson\u2019s insights on two things. The first is syntactical linguistics and the polemic (Sampson 2005) he wrote against Chomsky (who, on the other hand, is a good example of the real interaction between computing principles and languages. Unfortunately I maintain that he was not philosophically sound enough, he took historical languages as something given by nature. Nevertheless, he was very interesting in this regard). That book is wonderful. The second is encoding principles, which is joined to alphabet theory. Sampson has written a wonderful book about alphabets (Sampson 2015), strange for one who creates the British National Corpus, you see, but this is just what I say.

This is my personal experience: how can I tell the colleague in, for example, Italian literature that he does not really know the texts he studies? How can I tell him that he does not understand what a text is and in which sense we can say that this text is by Dante or not? Or, even more, what is the meaning of orthography in this and that manuscript? What is the difference between the actual material design of a letter and the idea of a grapheme as part of the graphic and the spoken apparatus of one language?\n\nThe colleague would tell me that I am completely crazy and that these are not problems and in any case he does not want to study them. This is probably because they are intuitive problems. However, when you have to teach a machine how to manage such data, you must tell the machine exactly what everything is and you realise that you don\u2019t know the answers to the questions I just asked! Here is where the normal Humanities scholar keeps back because he cannot accept all that. It is a long process and in due course the normal Humanities scholars may come to accept such issues about the difficulties of formally defining such phenomena. And this is \u201cla scommessa\u201d, the bet for the future, because from one side everything will be computerised. Whether we want that or not is not the problem \u2013 it will happen. And if so, the way that all the data of our disciplines will be computerised, the correctness of that depends on the generations from now on. And this is why I am very much, I will not say preoccupied, but why I try to think about this crucial problem.\n\nYou know, the trend now is infrastructures. The European community recommends the building of infrastructures for many domains but they will go by themselves. What is the idea of convening meetings on how to organise Humanities Computing infrastructures? Of course it takes money but they will have to build them in any case, with or without European money. Universities will have to build them at some point, and in any case it will cost them less and less. I don\u2019t see any research problems in the area of infrastructures, on the contrary. You will have huge amounts of data, of course, and bless it. But how will that data be put in digital form? That depends on a very delicate attitude and few people will understand that. Willard McCarty, Geoffrey Rockwell and Manfred Thaller will understand that, one, two, three and yet the phenomenon is spreading around the world. But we must not be pessimistic, of course! In any case we must realise that this is the great challenge of the next years. Let\u2019s try to sell that to responsible people even though it is not easy.\n",

I think that now it is different in Humanities too because they have acquired that sense of comradery that was not present at the time.\n",
