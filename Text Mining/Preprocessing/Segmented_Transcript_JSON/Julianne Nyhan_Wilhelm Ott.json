    "utterance": "\nYes, I thought it looked interesting and I had also some research problems which could perhaps be solved with it. In Theology I had worked on the New Testament and the differences on the teaching on prayer between the gospels (Ott 1965). In this context it was important to look for details in the speech and wording that the respective evangelist used. A lot of philological tools were available, there was special grammars and concordances for the New Testament \u2013 and I missed this in Classics. Therefore I thought that a computer could help.\n\nWhen I started the programming course in the spring of 1966 it was relatively early times for Humanities Computing. The first part of the coursework was in Assembler, this means working very near to the hardware of the machine. The second part was in FORTRAN, using a set of sub-routines for character and string handling that the Darmstadt group had just developed, because FORTRAN, at that time, did not even have a CHARACTER statement. With those sub-routines one could at least get access to single characters and to strings, and one was able to move strings and to collate strings and so on. After some days I found the exercises they did a bit annoying. Therefore, since I was working on Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, an epic poem written in dactylic hexameters, and since I had learned from Eduard Norden\u2019s Commentary on Book VI of the Aeneid (1957) how important it was to also pay attention to the \u201cpictorial elements\u201d of the hexameter when interpreting the poem, I tried to design a program to automatically compile the metrical characteristics which Norden had collected in the appendix to his commentary. It worked, and it was my first experience of thinking about the application of computers to the Humanities.\n\nWhen I started in Darmstadt I had just the basic tools. I had a FORTRAN compiler and I had that set of sub-routines. Later, when we moved from Darmstadt to T\u00fcbingen, it was an additional effort just to provide a set of sub-routines that were compatible with the Darmstadt ones and that would allow me to continue my work on a Control Data computer. In Darmstadt I had worked on an IBM 7090, and later a 7094.\n",

    "utterance": "\nWell, the programmes that I wrote for analysing the hexameter were not finished by the time the training course in Darmstadt had finished. I was not able to pay for the computing time after the course. The course itself was free, but then, after a fortnight or so they said, \u201cwell, now your work is perhaps a research project and you have to pay for your computing time\u201d. Computing time then cost 230 DM per hour, and this was a bit much for a student who lived on a scholarship of 400 DM per month.\n\nTherefore, I went to the Classics Department in T\u00fcbingen University where I continued my studies and showed them what I was working on to see whether they were interested. At the same time, the computing center had just moved out of the Mathematics Department and had become a central unit for the university, comparable to the university library. They saw the chance that in these circumstances they could also get advice for Humanities applications because I was a Humanist with a doctorate and I had proven that I had also some knowledge of computing. Therefore, they hired me, and the first thing I had to do was to continue my hexameter project but, of course, to also give advice and make it available to other interested people from the Humanities. With time those projects came.\n\nOne of the first projects that came was from outside the university. It was the concordance to the Vulgate, the Latin Bible, by Father Bonifatius Fischer (1977), a great project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). They had heard about me via IBM Germany, whom I had also contacted in order to find out what opportunities existed for continuing my work. I had contacted Dr H\u00fcbner of IBM in Sindelfingen who had also been a member of the Classics Department in T\u00fcbingen before he went to IBM. From this contact resulted the first contact with Bonifatius Fischer, more or less a year later.\n\nAnother large project also came from outside T\u00fcbingen. Prof. Kurt Aland from the University of M\u00fcnster wanted to prepare a new critical edition of the New Testament and so he wanted to determine which of the many manuscripts of the New Testament could be omitted from the apparatus. This problem required the grouping of the variant readings found by the manual collation of 98 selected passages of the Catholic letters, so as to find out the relationships between the approximately 500 manuscripts that contained the text.\n\nOther projects came in from the University of T\u00fcbingen. In 1969, one of the larger projects was an index to 75 volumes (1895\u20131970) of the Theologische Quartalschrift. Footnote2 Then in 1970, an index to the works of the middle-high German poet Heinrich Kaufringer was to be made by Paul Sappler of the German Department.Footnote3 It was to be an edition plus index. He had asked for the index and I advised him to also prepare the edition itself by computerised typesetting because then the data would be error-free for the index. In the meantime the TUSTEP typesetting programme (see below) was working. It was one of the first typesetting routines that could make up whole pages on a Digiset (the first digital typesetter). And, at the same time, a further project came from the Institute of Hebrew Studies at the University of T\u00fcbingen, an edition of the Mishna by Michael Krupp. This meant further problems and further challenges because the Hebrew fonts needed for the Mishna edition were not available for the Digiset at that time. The right to left reading was also difficult for processing and so on, but as a former student of Theology, I knew enough about Hebrew that I could get involved with this project.Footnote4\n",

The first thing I told him when he asked me to work on the concordance was \u201cwell, before starting we should have an error-free, machine-readable text of the Vulgate\u201d. The edition for which the concordance was planned was the new edition which he had just finished, together with Robert Weber. Fischer told me that he was not very good at proofreading; he was much better at typing. Therefore I told him, \u201cwell, then let us transcribe this text twice and compare the two transcriptions\u201d, and so we did, and it worked out very fine. I have also published a short article about this approach (Ott 1970).\n\nThen, in order to prepare the concordance, the word forms had to be lemmatised (which means using the word forms not as they occurred in the text but rather their dictionary forms, or Grundformen). And so I contacted Father Busa in Gallarate, or in Pisa, where he had just moved to, and asked him if he could give us a copy of his Lexicon Electronicum Latinum (LEL), as he called it.Footnote5 I visited him in Pisa and he generously gave us his lexicon and we took it as a basis for the lemmatisation. Later he asked me to give him a list of words which occurred in the Vulgate but not in Thomas of Aquinas so as to complement it \u2013 it worked fine.\n",

    "utterance": "\nYes. Regarding the lemmatisation itself, the first step was to isolate all the word forms that occurred in the text. A speciality of this concordance was that it included not only the words of the text but also the entries that appeared in the apparatus criticus. So the apparatus entries were also transcribed. The second step was to sort the word forms alphabetically. The third step was then to mix into this sorted material the entries from the Busa lexicon. For each word form of the Latin text of the Bible we got an average of two and a half lemmata, depending, of course, on the frequency of the homograph word forms in Latin. For example, est, \u2018he is\u2019 or \u2018it is\u2019, could not be only a form of esse, \u2018to be\u2019 but also of edere, \u2018to eat\u2019. These are homographs. Another simple example is facies, which can be \u2018the face\u2019 or it can be a verb form of facio.\n\nThen, after the lemmata had been intermixed with the sorted list of words, they were sorted back into the sequence of the text because otherwise you cannot determine which form corresponds to which lemmata in a given context. Then, a new printed list was produced again, where after each line of text all the word forms that occurred in this line were printed in separate lines along with the respective lemmata. Then the manual work that established which of the lemmata was appropriate in that place started. For this work Fischer had engaged a monastery of Benedictine nuns in Kempen on the Rhine. All of them had an Abitur (final secondary-school examinations) with Latin as a second language, and therefore they were very happy with this work which was of course, closely controlled or surveyed by Bonifaitus Fischer. They did work for some years on the lemmatisation.\n\nFor this step of manually controlling the word forms for which more than one lemma had been found in the lexicon, I had arranged the materials (that is the lines showing word forms plus lemma below each bible verse) so that the most probable lemma was the first one listed. For example, for est, the first was not edere but esse, though edere is, in alphabetic order, before esse. I tried to pay attention to the frequency in order to have the most probable solution in the first place. When, in this list, the first lemma was right, then nothing had to be done. If the second or the third lemma was the correct one then the following had simply to be typed: the number of the line and of the word which was printed in this list plus the current number of the correct lemma. Then, the material was sorted back into alphabetic order again, not according to the inflected forms but according to the lemmata. Then the material was prepared for printing using the typesetting programme that had also been developed in the course of the work on this concordance. It was from this project that I first learned that it was important to have a programme that could transport the results of philological work error-free to print. But that is a totally different theme of course!\n\nAt the time the project started, the typesetting industry was still relying on hot metal typesetting, lead typesetting. Indeed, due to a hint from Dr H\u00fcbner of IBM, the first contact that I had in this context was with the printing house of the Mittelbayerische Zeitung (a newspaper publisher) in Regensburg, who had a Linotype driven by paper tape. This paper tape was being prepared by a computer programme, which just provided for automatic line breaks including correct hyphenation. Well, hyphenation and line division were not important for us because the content of the Vulgate was short enough that it normally fit into a line and hyphenation for Latin was also not a problem for the concordance. The control of the typesetter itself was a problem. I had just written the first test when the notice came that the first cathode ray tube typesetter had been installed in Neu-Isenburg. Then I left the programmes that I had started for the Linotype and looked for a way to get access to the Digiset for the typesetting. Digiset was produced by the Hell company in Kiel and was the first cathode ray tube typesetter (see, for example, Sassoon 1993, p.76, 78, 88); in the States it was marketed as VideoComp by RCA Corporation. I got in contact with Lux Bildstudio in Neu-Isenburg and then I tried to prepare a programme so that this typesetter could be used for the publication of our data.\n",

He had just written the hyphenation of German programme for the Linotype typesetter. He also had many contacts and it was due to him that the contact to Father Fischer had been established. The contact with Father Fischer also came about via the publisher Frommann-Holzboog in Stuttgart. From the course in Darmstadt and also from H\u00fcbner I got the names of some people and some projects and I tried to contact them too.\n\nThere were also some people outside of Germany. I contacted Professor Louis Delatte of the Laboratoire d\u2019Analyse Statistique des Langues Anciennes in LiegeFootnote6 relatively early in July 1966. I visited him in October and reported on my approach and he found it very interesting, and gave me the hint that it should be advisable to publish or to prepare a paper on it, and to publish it in his Revue. So, in fact, in the last number of the Revue of 1966, I had the first paper on my computer-aided hexameter studies (Ott 1966). Many people worldwide, who then contacted me, found this paper interesting. One of the first was Joseph Raben from New York, who wanted a notice for CHum. I don\u2019t remember the first contact that I had with Stephen Waite (of Dartmouth College), who had been editing Calculi, his bi-monthly periodical for computer applications in the Classics since 1967. Father Busa, I just mentioned and reported that I contacted him in the context of the concordance to the Vulgate in April 1967. I visited him and Antonio Zampolli (his assistant at that time) in July of 1967. The contact to Kurt Aland from M\u00fcnster had also been established by Bonifatius Fischer, who as an editor of Vulgate, of course, had close contacts with him.\n\nOther international contacts came via the hexameter project. In September 1969, there was a large conference of La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale des associations d\u2019\u00e9tudes classiques (FIEC) in Bonn.Footnote7 It had about 800 participants, and they also asked me to give a report on my hexameter project (Ott 1969), and on this occasion, I came into contact with, for example, David Packard, who later founded the Packard Foundation.\n\nOther contacts came too. Just about 4 years after my appointment to the Computing Center, in 1970, I heard of a conference Professor Roy Wisbey was organising in Cambridge. I wrote him a letter to ask if I was allowed to come to this conference, which seemed, at first glance, to be a national conference for England. In fact, I was the only German participant there and through it I made contacts with other important people, for example, Susan Hockey.\n",

He was convinced that metrics were important for interpreting a poem and had a lot of criteria that he looked for: the number of words and the position of the word endings in respect to the verse structure. In the middle of a hexameter there is normally also a caesura (or a pause) and he also looked for where exactly this caesura is on average, or in most verses, and so on.\n\nTherefore, one of the tools I provided, and which I thought it was possible to provide beyond the printed lists, was a tool to allow one to look for combinations of word endings in the verse. I thought that it could be done relatively easily using a punched card. The punched card had 80 columns, with at least 10 positions that could easily be numbered vertically. Additional rows 12 and 11, as they were called, were not used for representing the number of lines, or the number of verses. Therefore I provided 16 punched cards, one for each position in the hexameter, as the hexameter consists of 6 feet, and each foot can have either two or three syllables: two long syllables, or one long syllable and two short syllables (that makes 16 times three, or 18, but the verse end is always a word end. Therefore it can be neglected and the last foot is almost always two syllables only. That meant I had 16 positions that were interesting). And so, I provided 16 punched cards. On each card I made a hole in the respective position. Where, for example, a word ended just after the first syllable in line three of a poem, I made a hole in the first card in column zero, row three and this indicated the occurrence of a monosyllabic word at the beginning of the verse. And this I did for the 16 positions in the verse and for every line. Then, if you want to see if, for example, a verse that starts with a monosyllable, and ends with a monosyllable, you just take the first and last card and put them together, one above the other, hold them against the light, and where the holes are shining through, there you have the number of the lines of the verses which start and end with a monosyllabic word.

In fact, the first volume that I published with a programme that I wrote for the Digiset was not the Vulgate, but the first volume of my hexameter studies. One of the other earliest projects to use this typesetting program was the edition of the works of Kaufringer by Paul Sappler, which was to be published by Niemeyer. Paul Sappler asked Niemeyer if, instead of delivering a manuscript, he could just typeset it. The technical production manager of Niemeyer, Wolfgang Reiner, saw it just as he was looking for a replacement for hot metal typesetting. He got in contact with me and proposed to make this service available commercially for typesetting in publishing houses. We decided to found the firm pagina (pagina is a Latin word for the page). The programme I had made was the first programme, as far as I know, that did not only provide hyphenation and line breaks but also complete page make-up, including page numbering, running heads and so on. So we founded pagina: the name comes from the ready-made pages we created, and it was a typesetting firm for, more or less, publishers in the Humanities, because Niemeyer was, of course, also in this field.\n",

    "utterance": "\nAs I said, I was hired by the university to give advice and support to Humanities projects. The first thing I did was to make available the tools I used (this was the set of sub-routines for character handling in FORTRAN) and to give FORTRAN courses. Paul Sappler, and Gottfried Reeg (from 1984 at FU Berlin) started with those tools and programmed by themselves. We did the programming for other people in the computing center. As the number of projects increased, it was no longer possible to continue as before. Therefore we thought of a way to make the users a bit more independent by allowing them to do much of the work for themselves. We tried to isolate the most common basic functions that were needed for Humanities Computing.Footnote11\n\nOne, for example, was a programme, it was indeed a separate programme in the beginning, which extracted particular sentences or records or a certain string from a file, for example. Another programme, it was also a separate programme, did search and replace functions on a file. Other basic functions related to preparing an index and allowed one to firstly break down the text into index entries, then to provide a sort key for the index, then to sort the material and then to reduce the sorted material to index entries. For example, I don\u2019t want to have 750 individual entries for the copula und (and) along with 750 individual references to it. I want the information to be summarised in one line. Neither do I want 750 references to frequent words, I only want their frequency, for example. Proceeding in such a modular way was one of the lessons I had learned through the concordance to the Vulgate.\n\nWhen we started the concordance there were just two or three programmes available that produced concordances. One of them was COCOA, the word count and concordance programme provided by ATLAS in Great Britain, which later was the basis for the Oxford Concordance Program (OCP) by Susan Hockey and Ian Marriot. Susan Hockey was at Atlas before she moved to Oxford and co-developed the OCP programme. There was a further programme in Regensburg COBAPH (COBOL basic programmes for Philology), which also produced concordances, but these programs were more or less black boxes. You had some parameters that you could give along with your input text, then you got a concordance, but it was not lemmatised.\n\nSo I thought that, as problems are different in every field of the Humanities, we should provide the basic functions. I just mentioned that we included the critical apparatus in the concordance to the Vulgate. Therefore, I realised that the procedure for decomposing texts must be flexible and that it should be possible to define the details by parameters given by the user. The second step was providing the sort key. If you sort an English text or a Latin text, an ASCII key is just fine. However, when dealing with German texts, for example, you must take account of two different rules. One is for sorting lists of proper names, where you sort the umlauts as \u2018a + e\u2019 or \u2018o + e\u2019 or \u2018u + e\u2019, whereas you have to sort the umlauts as the basic letters without the trema or the umlaut dots in all other cases, as is done in subject indexes or in a dictionary. I think that if people from different faculties and different subject areas are to be helped, then we must provide the basic tools and the ability for them to define them according to their needs. Then the sorting (if the sort key is ok) is a purely mechanical thing. So this is also a separate module, which provides some efficiency and so on. The third step in this process of producing an index is, as I just said, to prepare the entries that have been sorted in the form required for publishing in print or on the web etc. If, like in the concordance to the Vulgate, you have a normal wordlist, it\u2019s relatively easy. If the text is indexed according to the subjects it contains, you will have a hierarchy of subjects, with a heading concept and sub-concepts and you will also want to show this. In such a case you should have also the possibility to define in detail how these records are to be built and presented.\n\nWith such elementary modules, users no longer had to care about programming in FORTRAN (or a similar language). They had those modules and they could specify input files and parameters, and they got an output file which could be used as input for the next module. Well, this is the concept we had; and in the course of time the modules turn out to be rich and sufficiently complete, so that in 1977, I think it was, I gave my last FORTRAN course. From 1977 we just instructed users on using those modules, and in 1978, when the child had some maturity, we baptised it, and called it T\u00fcbingen System of Text Processing Programmes, TUSTEP.\n",

The field that we tried to support was the field where Humanities people had problems that were not necessarily the mainstream of the field. Preparing an edition is a very laborious task and nobody becomes really known for having prepared a good edition. Indexing is also hard work and nobody becomes famous for preparing a fine index. One would perhaps say that those times and problems were connected with close reading and not with what nowadays is called big data and distant reading. Of course, the development of the web and the availability of material, and so forth, requires those questions to be asked. Yet, sometimes I have the impression that they are asked with too little real knowledge of what is being asked. You and I have spoken about the case of N-grams, where the results were not as exact as they should be because, for example, they could not consistently differentiate between the long s and f in some scanned documents. Nevertheless, big data and the availability of the data opens the possibility of asking new questions which could not otherwise be asked about the development of language, and so on. But it\u2019s another field of problems from that which we tackled.\n\nOur TUSTEP software is more or less a set of tools for single works and it is also for development and for the analysis, editing and indexing of textual documents. It is not only for textual documents, but also for documentation. Many library catalogues have also been made with the tools we provided.

For example, the TUSTEP typesetting programme is the first one I know of that is able to typeset documents with XML encoding and to provide a stylesheet for typesetting them. There are, of course, some other reasons that TUSTEP is not very well known internationally and, perhaps also in the meantime, less accepted in the German-speaking environment. One factor is the language of documentation: it\u2019s in German only. In 1989 we had an English translation of the manual done but this is now out of date and we did not have the means to continue this work because all the funding of the Forschungschwerpunkt (mentioned above) had ceased in 1989. The second factor is the command-line-based interface.\n\nTherefore, for some years we have been working on an interface to the TUSTEP programmes in an XML environment. It\u2019s called TXSTEP, we just changed the \u2018u\u2019 in TUSTEP to an \u2018x\u2019. In the meantime we have one user for it, working on the Faust edition in Frankfurt. They are using it especially for collating the sources of the Faust material. This XML interface for TUSTEP has the advantage that it\u2019s based on an XML schema that remains in the background but informs you about what steps are possible, what basic modules are available and so on. Annotations and instructions in pop-up windows indicate in English whether something is possible and this helps a bit to get rid of the language problem and of the necessity of studying the manual in advance. So I hope that such developments will perhaps help to make those tools a bit more attractive, also in the non-German speaking environment and in an environment where you are no longer willing to use command-line-based interfaces. Also, XML is not as \u2018user-friendly\u2019 as one might expect from other computing applications. But at least people who are accustomed to using computers nowadays are used to an XML environment for tools. This will also perhaps help with the switch to an application of this kind.\n",
