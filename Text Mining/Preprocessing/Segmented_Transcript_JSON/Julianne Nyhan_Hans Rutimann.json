The MLA at that time was in the process of introducing a computer, mainly to help with administrative tasks.Footnote1 I was a research assistant at the organisation, having come from Switzerland just a year or two before, and I heard about the arrival of the computer and a whole staff was hired: an Operator, Punched Card Operators, Programmers etc. I had nothing to do with it, I was doing a study on the teaching of German in high schools. But then the computer arrived, it was a 360/20, which is the smallest in that famous 360 line and the preparations were on-going. In spite of its size, the 360/20 had a memory of only 12 K, later augmented to 16 K. A programmer in those days spent more time sub-dividing programs than writing whole programs.\n\nThen there was small scandal at the organisation when the Head of Computing, as we called it then, had a romantic liaison with the woman who was hired to be the Operator. The Executive Director of the MLA was very offended by that, he was the son of a missionary, and he fired everybody connected with the computer. It just came to a standstill and he called me up and said \u201cI saw in your resum\u00e9 that you worked in a Swiss bank, so you\u2019re probably good with numbers. Would you like to make a go of it and try to help us with this new computer?\u201d\n\nThe computer was huge, at that time it filled a room that had a double floor and extra air conditioning. I said I would think about it, thought about it and I said \u201cyes\u201d and went to training classes. But that\u2019s really leading into your second question, \u201cdid you receive formal training in programming and computing?\u201d At that time the IBM customer service was excellent and I took courses in operating and programming. Regarding the work, the first task was to convert the membership list, an address list of about 30,000 members, which at that time were still on metal plates on what we called an addressograph machine.Footnote2 Those were all punched on cards. So that was my beginning.\n",

So, when you finished your programme you had to line up and sort of sign up for your programme to be evaluated. At that time you had to run it against a compiler, which was about 1000 cards, to turn the programme that you have written into what we called the project deck.

As we worked on converting all the administrative tasks (accounting, budgeting, membership services etc.) so that they could be done with computing, we also had an outside firm compose the MLA International Bibliography (MLA IB). By \u2018composing\u2019 I mean that we would prepare a tape with all the typesetting codes and they would then set the type from this tape. We did that for a few years, I\u2019m now moving through the 1970s and we produced the MLA IB, which was at that time the largest reference work for English, Foreign Languages, Folklore and Linguistics. Then, I\u2019m skipping a few years now, we also looked into the possibility of making this available \u2018online\u2019 and that leads to another anecdote!\n\nWe worked at that time with a company called Lockheed, the airplane manufacturer in California. They made databases available for online searching. The MLA was the first organisation to make a reference work in the Humanities available online. I remember very well, we produced a tape and stripped it of all photo-typesetting composition codes. It was one of the large tapes, you know, the old tapes, I don\u2019t know if you recall those? [JN: No] They were quite large, about 15 inches in diameter. They were called the seven-track tapes. I had one under my arm and I took a plane from New York to Palo Alto, San Francisco. I drove to Lockheed and gave them the tape and they made it available online as the first international database in the Humanities.\n\nAnd I remember so well, I flew back to New York and we bought one of those early online terminals. It was not really a terminal, it was a telephone with two rubber receptacles: you dialled the number, and you put the receiver in those rubber receptacles and then you typed in your search query. I remember I jumped with joy when the first results came in and I marvelled aloud that this was from 3000 miles away and I got the answers that I requested. Of course the searching was nowhere near the sophistication of today but it worked and proved to be very successful. I then negotiated, now we\u2019re moving into the late 1970s or early 1980s, with the Wilson Company in New York, a publisher of articles and books for the library world. The Wilson Quarterly also had an online service. We produced the first CD of the MLA IB to be made available through Wilson. So that was all very exciting for our membership and the usage increased, we got royalties, and it was a success, as I recall.\n",

We began to dabble in all of this but not very seriously because most of that work was done at universities. I saw my role as an enabler and that goes on to another question. Very early on, there was a very active group of people in the MLA, dealing with computers and the Humanities. That was also the time that the journal CHum came out, and we organised an Association of Computers and the Humanities. I was on the board and they were looking at first for an opportunity to meet and to talk about issues and to plan the next steps. I made the conference room of the MLA available to a small group and that turned out to be the founding, not the founding meeting, but the beginning of the Text Encoding Initiative. And so the early beginnings of TEI were really at the MLA in a conference room that I made available to that group, just an aside.Footnote3\n\nAnd you have a question \u201cwhich people particularly influenced you and how?\u201d I would like to mention Joseph Raben. I think he\u2019s retired by now. He was the person who influenced me greatly, he was a professor at Queen\u2019s College. He founded the journal CHum; he was also very active in the ACH. He and I worked very closely in those years on another aspect that I think I should mention. The MLA has an annual meeting, a fairly large gathering of its members, it usually draws about 10,000 members. Parallel to the convention we had book publishers organize a huge exhibit of scholarly books. Early on, Joseph Raben and I felt that it would be very interesting to have some computer-related activities at that exhibit. At that time there was a lot of talk about computer-assisted education, computer-assisted teaching, computer-aided teaching, it went by all kinds of names. We invited hardware manufacturers, software publishers and related industries to exhibit at the convention. At that point I visualised that this would be so successful that in the next couple of decades the computer-related exhibitors would outnumber the traditional book publishers. Well, it didn\u2019t quite happen that quickly. At that time we had maybe three or four, I remember Apple was one of the first to agree to come. Now, when I look at the convention programme some 30 to 40 years later, I notice that there are quite a few more. They\u2019re still not in the majority but getting there. Joseph Raben and I worked on that very intensively and he was a huge help because of his contacts and his knowledge.\n",

We\u2019re talking now about the 1990s, and later, when I became a Senior Advisor to the Mellon Foundation. That was (or is, I\u2019m still doing that) in the Scholarly Communication and the Technology Information programme.Footnote4 That\u2019s where I really became involved in all kinds of projects in this country and also abroad. They included the sophisticated digitisation of medieval manuscript collections, infrastructure problems and projects like Bamboo (see, for example, Dombrowski 2014). But while I was at the MLA I just had peripheral contact with the group that was involved with Computing and the Humanities.\n\nCan I just go forward on your list because you\u2019re asking a very interesting question? One of the questions is \u201cwhat about scholars who were not using computers in their research? Do you have a sense of what their views on Humanities Computing were?\u201d Yes, indeed I do, on many levels. First of all, I experienced a lot of hostility early on, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I heard comments along the lines of \u201ccomputers have no business in Humanities disciplines, computing is a scientific instrument and we don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it\u201d. And that, of course, changed over time with more and more people getting involved in computing and research. But the interesting thing was that at that time it was very difficult to get any kind of recognition for computing work in the scholarly community (and I think that\u2019s still a sore point today). So any kind of work, be that research with the help of a computer, or the creation of software, or anything related to computing, at that time anyway, got very little recognition. The desire of the Humanities Computing community was to get the same kind of recognition that you would get by having an article published in a peer-reviewed journal but that was not the case. But then slowly it began to change. I think today you get a little more recognition but from reading the literature, I realise that we\u2019re not quite there in terms of equivalency with a peer-reviewed article. That was my experience; the hostility against computing early on in the 1960s was profound.\n",
