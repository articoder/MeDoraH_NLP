    "utterance": "\nWell, I go way back. I was in college in the early 1960s and I majored in Math. My mother at one point said, \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to be a Math teacher?\u201d meaning in high school. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so\u201d and she said, \u201cWell, what are you going to do?\u201d I didn\u2019t have a good idea. So, I went to my adviser at the College and she gave me some books about careers in Mathematics and one of the things in one of the books was about computer programming. I didn\u2019t really know what that was. I\u2019d heard of computers but didn\u2019t know anything about them.\n\nLike I said, I was majoring in Math and the university where I was had no computer courses at all until my senior year. A friend of mine, who was in the Graduate School of Engineering, told me that there was a 1 hour course in FORTRAN 2 and because I was a senior I could take the graduate course. I signed up for that but didn\u2019t learn anything about the computer. All I knew was that you put cards in one side of this machine and you pushed a button and some more cards came out the other side of the machine. You ran them through another device to get the print out to see what had happened, and then you fixed the errors and went through that whole process again. But it was fascinating to me! I thought programming was kind of like playing a game or solving a puzzle, so I was excited about it.\n\nAt the end of my senior year I decided to go on to graduate school and get my masters in English Literature. With those tremendous credentials I got a job [1965\u20131966] working for IBM at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. I was trained for 6 weeks. The people they hired were smart, had logical ability and passed the programming aptitude test but none of them had any background in Computer Science because it wasn\u2019t taught anywhere. About 20 of us were in the class and we were then assigned to different places. I worked as an assembly language programmer out at the Jet Propulsion Lab on one of the early unmanned space shots to the moon.\n",

After a while, though, management wanted me to only teach classes, which I did. I would teach 6 week sessions starting with an Introduction to Computers, then Assembly Language Programming and finally Systems Programming. It wasn\u2019t anything terrible but it was not what I was interested in doing. It\u2019s kind of ironic that I ended up teaching Computer Science at the academic level, but that\u2019s very different from 6 hours a day for 6 weeks straight. Sometimes I would teach Computer Operations as well. I wasn\u2019t happy teaching and asked for more client work. My request wasn\u2019t granted so I decided to go back to graduate school.\n\nI went straight into an English Literature programme at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and concentrated on bibliographical methodology, among other things. My adviser took me over to the Humanities Research Center and we found about 200 pages of one of Dylan Thomas\u2019 manuscripts. The first thing that came to my mind after several years of saying I wasn\u2019t going to have anything to do with computers was \u201cif I put this on the computer, I can get it all sorted out\u201d. So that turned into my dissertation, Computer Collation of Manuscript Poetry: Dylan Thomas\u2019 \u2018Poem on his Birthday\u2019 (Harris Fosberg 1975). I got a lot of flack from the Department about my work. One of the graduate advisers swore that I was trying to destroy literature by using the computer.\n",

Nell Dale taught the class and became a lifelong friend. At that time she was in the Computer Science Department and working on her dissertation as a Computer Science graduate student. I don\u2019t remember the details of her dissertation but it had something to do with taking a text and trying to find the words that showed emotions of different sorts. In the class We used the SNOBOL language to do some programming. We learned about various things that were going on in Humanities Computing. Nell put me in touch with the field, and it gave me some confidence in what I was doing, that I wasn\u2019t the only person in the whole wide world who was trying to use a computer in literature.\n\nRegarding what I said about having trouble getting access to the computer, I ended up having to apply for a graduate student grant in order to get an account set up with the computer centre, because in those days the English Department had no account. I never knew why there was no contact between the English Department and the Computer Science Department back then. It had never occurred to any of them to think about using computers on campus. I\u2019m not even sure they used computers for keeping student rolls. So, I got a small grant that gave me enough money for the computer time (which was fairly minimal) and the computer paper. It all had to be charged to something, so that was how I handled that.\n\nLater, when I taught in Computer Science at UT Austin, the English Department had a program for combining English and Computer Science, but, of course, that was 30 years later.\n",

Even though I was teaching Computer Science, my research focused on the Humanities initially and eventually I shifted into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and never really got back to the Humanities directly for various reasons.\n\nThe training I got was for what we called second generation IBM computers. The third generation at IBM was the 360, which was the basic architecture that is still the foundation for mainframe IBM computers now, after all these years. That was when they switched from octal to hexadecimal; in other words, they developed the 8-bit byte and combined bytes for various data structures. So I learned that a little later. I was initially trained on the IBM 7000 series, mainly. The system I ended up working on was a 7094 with 7040 and 7044 systems attached. Anyway, we were trained in assembly language because in those days if you didn\u2019t know the machine-level language, they just assumed you didn\u2019t know anything. The 1 hour course in FORTRAN from college was helpful but not of any use to what I was going to be doing. In the 6 week training class we learned from the very bottom. I remember that when I started actually programming at JPL they had several different computer systems on different floors. These were duplicates of the systems described above \u2013 I think there were six systems all together. The production system had its backup system and there were two development systems with their own backups.\n\nI\u2019m sure along the way you\u2019ve seen the big room where everybody\u2019s sitting at a device and something great happens and they all stand up and cheer? That was the main production area; we were not allowed in there. Only the JPL scientists worked in there. Our job was to develop diagnostic software that would essentially exercise the hardware and investigate whether or not it was functioning the way it was supposed to. This was very different from today where the hardware tests itself. Back then we actually felt that software was more reliable than hardware. Everything in the computer was wired together by hand and you could get a loose wire that would make everything go haywire. So, it was a very different world. I would think of myself as sitting inside the computer and moving things around in order to accomplish whatever the goal of my programming was. In those days, the computer had a great big front with lights blinking and you could actually set switches to change the value of a word in the computer memory and then restart your program with new values. That\u2019s how you could debug \u2013 I mean we\u2019re talking way back! But it was really interesting and a great background for teaching Computer Science. I\u2019ve never figured out for sure how it influenced my use of computers in the Humanities. But I\u2019m sure it did give me a very different perspective, particularly from people who were coming from the Humanities and then later learning computing.\n",

    "utterance": "\nYes, I mentioned that I first taught Computer Science in Oklahoma. It really was a hard position because I taught so many different courses. But I taught everything so I learned a whole lot. Then I went to Loyola in New Orleans. I wrote several papers about some of the things that we did there to change the curriculum to fit a small liberal arts college while still teaching everything that a Computer Science student should know (See, for example Harris Fosberg 1981, 1982). I also wrote papers on teaching NLP at the undergraduate level. Based on that I wrote a book, the Introduction to Natural Language Processing (1985), which was the first college text book in the field. Other books had come out but they were mostly compilations of papers from various conference. I had already taught the NLP course so I thought, \u201cWell! You know what? I can do this!\u201d My book didn\u2019t stay in publication for very long, but I think it inspired some other people to write books in the field and I can always say mine was first.\n\nBased on that book, I was contacted by a company in the Washington DC area, SRA, which is now SRA International. They were setting up a Department of Artificial Intelligence and wanted to talk to me about going to work for them. I flew up there to talk to them about what they were doing and to meet the people they\u2019d already hired. I moved from New Orleans up to Washington DC in 1986, and I worked for that company for about 3 years. We did a variety of projects, mostly related to NLP. One was a project for the Air Force. The back end of it was an expert system that was related to flying sorties over Europe and the front end of it was a natural language interface so a person could ask questions about flying sorties by typing questions in English. It would output answers mostly in a kind of canned text. Although the Air Force never did anything with that project it actually was fairly successful in terms of what we were able to understand. There wasn\u2019t a lot of work available related to NLP at that point so the company kept trying to move me into different areas.\n\nI decided after 3 years that I would go to work for myself. I worked as an independent consultant for about 10 years and called my little venture \u2018Language Technology\u2019. I worked for almost 6 years with the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the GRE SATFootnote2 folks here in the US, and did a variety of projects for them including a project to automatically score essays that were part of the SATs or other exams. A computer and a human would score an essay. Then, if they didn\u2019t match, they would have a second human look at it, so the system wasn\u2019t totally dependent on the computer. It saved them a lot of money because they didn\u2019t have to pay two humans to mark all the essays.\n\nIn the meantime, I had moved back to Austin in 1997, and was finishing up one project with ETS when UT Austin contacted me about teaching for them. There was another computer boom shortly before Y2K when everybody was trying to hire programmers to fix things so they needed more faculty. I taught there for about 5 years, until 2002. I initially taught a course called \u2018Contemporary Issues in Computer Science\u2019, kind of like a \u2018Computers in Society\u2019 course but focused on the Computer Science part of it. I suggested teaching a NLP course since that was what I loved and ended up teaching that four or five times. I also worked with undergraduates doing research on a project with the AI Laboratory. I had a number of students who went on to do graduate work in NLP, based on the work we had done, so that was very rewarding. To add the final bit to it before we move off to something else, the last semester I was there, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be teaching at UT anymore and wasn\u2019t sure what I would be doing. I found out from one of the professors in the Computer Science Department that there was a small start-up company looking for somebody to do natural language generation work for their system. It was an electronic medical records system that needed to produce a narrative based on the data that the doctor had input about the patient. I ended up working for them for 9 years and then I retired from there in 2010. And that\u2019s my career.\n",

It was really tedious to deal with punch cards and magnetic tape and that level of technology and lots of the language work was restricted because of the limitations of computer speed and computer memory sizes. But a lot of us really hard-headed people who wanted to do computing on Humanities subjects just kept at it. Gradually the disciplines of Literature and History began to see areas where the computer could actually help research and that it wasn\u2019t going to destroy literature. It could help sort things out and help find patterns in novels or in plays and so on. It was very gradual and had a lot to do with the technology improving.\n\nAlso, those of us in Humanities Computing were learning more and more from each other as we organised and spread the word. There was still a fair amount of reluctance about people in say Computer Science teaching if their work was primarily in the Humanities and vice versa. I think that continued for a long time when people tried to get jobs. In fact, that may still be the case in some places, but the direct opposition became less over the years. One thing that would have made me write that was my change in jobs. In the position I had in Oklahoma, they were not at all helpful. When I moved to Loyola in New Orleans, they were very helpful and very encouraging.

I mean it was obvious to me that I needed to be working, so if I was going to be working then I needed to be doing something that I really enjoyed. I could never see any reason not to combine the fields. And like I said, when I saw those manuscripts, I mean 200 pages of handwritten manuscripts is lot of material and what would you do? Write it out on index cards and try to sort it that way? That was basically the way people had been doing things. That was the option!\n\nSo the idea of putting it on the computer, of typing in all the words and all the lines from the written manuscripts and seeing how they would work together just seemed logical to me. Why wouldn\u2019t you do it? I think because I had training in more than one field that I could make those connections, that synergy that comes from seeing how things work in more than one field of study. Over the years, I have found many, many people who were interested in more than one thing. Maybe they were attracted to me because of my background, but I used to say to my undergraduate Computer Science students, \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in Journalism as well as Computer Science, take some courses; there\u2019s going to be a need for people in Journalism (or in History etc.) who know computers\u201d. Back then it was unusual to combine fields but I think there\u2019s been more acceptance of interdisciplinary studies over the years. And I think some of the studies of creativity have really backed up the notion that when you\u2019ve been trained to think in more than one way you have more than just that combination. It is that whole idea of synergy, that one plus one makes more than two, if you will.\n",

I think we were all very encouraging to anybody new because we felt like we just wanted to increase our ranks so that we wouldn\u2019t be quite as alone. I remember some of the early meetings. I can\u2019t remember everybody\u2019s name but a good friend was Donald Ross, at the University of Minnesota and there was a fellow Jim Joyce out in San Francisco. Also Jeffrey Huntsman at Indiana. And other people from across the country who were mostly working independently and had come together.

Of course, the thing about Humanities Computing is that it can be done in Industry, it can be done in Academia, and it can be done in, say, heritage contexts like museums and libraries.

The first was a fairly traditional marriage, and my husband expected me to go where he was, which I did. That\u2019s the way we did things then. There was not the agreement of \u201cwe are in this together\u201d. Even at one point, when I had a very strong opportunity and he didn\u2019t have a job at all, he didn\u2019t want to go because it was my opportunity and not his, so we didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I was married the second time, it was kind of the opposite. I basically told him from the beginning, \u201cI have a career and I intend to keep working at it and if you are willing to come along with me we can work this out\u201d and that worked. But part of the reason for moving around so much was because I was in this oddball field and having trouble finding an academic job. When I was trying to finish my dissertation, I did a number of things just to support myself. I worked as a typist for about 6 months and then I got a job working in New Orleans for a little computer company in Massachusetts (early telecommuting). Later I took a job as a bartender in the French quarter for about a year just to pay the bills while I finished my dissertation. Then I taught at Loyola in the Computer Science Department where I later came back in a tenure track position. It wasn\u2019t a straight path.\n\nIf you get a job straight out of getting your PhD, you may stay in that job forever. But since we didn\u2019t have easy access to academic positions I think that some of us moved around. Not everybody, I mean a lot of people stayed in the same field. My split field was a positive in many ways because of the work I did but it was a negative in terms of what people thought of me and thought of my ability, without looking at what I had done. I can\u2019t say I ever got used to it, but I certainly got to the point where I wasn\u2019t surprised by it. Even in the last job I had, people would say, \u201cOh, I know you know about language,\u201d but they just assumed I didn\u2019t know anything about computers and it\u2019s sort of like, \u201cHow do you think I got here if I didn\u2019t know anything about computers?\u201d\n",

And there was another woman called Patricia K. Galloway. She\u2019s teaching in the School of Information at UT Austin now but she was in Mississippi for quite a while in the Department of Archives and History. She was the person who put me in touch with NLP and showed me where to look things up and who were the people that were working in that field and so on. Those were pivotal points.\n\nI had a couple of Professors, the two thesis advisers here at UT, Warner Barnes and William B. Todd, who supported me emotionally, if you will, as well as academically and intellectually, in terms of following up on this idea because it just was so off the wall. To get back to your previous question on that, one of the things that I found when I came back to graduate school after having worked at IBM in the computer industry, was that I felt kind of like a fish out of water because most of the other graduate students had always been in school. You know, they might have had a summer job or worked at a camp somewhere or have done something to support themselves, but they had never been in the business world for any length of time. I remember in one of the poetry classes, we were analysing some poem by Wallace Stevens and the images that I came up with were so off the wall compared to these other students. I remember finding out later that he was an insurance agent who wrote poetry on the side, so I was possibly closer in terms of seeing the world the way that he did than these people with all their academic experience in literature. I think moving back and forth like that did give me a different perspective at each point.\n",

So, we accepted any comers in those days whether you would officially be defined as in the Humanities or not. Initially the group was almost entirely literature and then we started expanding into History and Archaeology and various other non-technical fields. I think that was one thing that made a difference. Because of the academic support that I got from Loyola, I was able to travel and really make connections. Of course, at that point the ALLC and Susan Hockey (see Chap. 6) and her colleagues were doing quite well in Europe. But bridging that gap was another part of it, I think, and one of the contributions that I started and that Nancy Ide certainly continued.\n\nThis has been very entertaining to me because I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking back on those days. Most of the people I know nowadays have only a vague idea that I did something in the computer field and they don\u2019t have a clue about the details of what I did.
