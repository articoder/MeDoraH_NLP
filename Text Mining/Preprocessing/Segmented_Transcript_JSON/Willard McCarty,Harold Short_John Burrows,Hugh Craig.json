If I\u2019d tackled some other stylistically-duller author I\u2019d probably have given up long before, but she just kept seducing me, which is something Ms Austen might not have wished to hear. And then, shortly after my conversation with John Lambert in August or September 1979, I went off to Cambridge for a year and had the good fortune to meet John Dawson [the Manager of Cambridge University Literary and Linguistic Computer Centre]. Through John and another man whose name escapes me at the moment, Robinson I think, I was told about Susan Hockey (see Chap. 6) and the work in Oxford University Computing Services. So, between Dawson\u2019s center in Cambridge and Hockey\u2019s center in Oxford, I was doing a lot of criss-cross travelling in the course of that year and learned a great deal and got a lot of encouragement and support to continue. I think I struck a lot of good luck, in a number of ways, early on when one might have been discouraged.\n\nWMC\nYes, stories of good luck are to be expected.

We\u2019ve learned a great amount about the details of the ways in which language works. As Hugh was saying a while ago, it\u2019s becoming increasingly possible to reach out to larger and larger corpora as the capacity and speed of computers improves, so that we\u2019re able to do more with less and we know much more than we did about the intricacies of stylistic patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s never-the-less true that as Argamon (2012) says \u2013 I don\u2019t agree with his derogatory way of saying it, he says that the field is a mess \u2013 that there have been some major achievements.
