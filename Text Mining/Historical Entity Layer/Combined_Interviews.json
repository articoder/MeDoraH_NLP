I was a Philosophy student at the University of Trondheim, Norway and across the corridor was the Institute of Continental Shelf Research. They had computer terminals that were accessible to all students, thus also to us. Not many students of Humanities were very interested, but since it was across the corridor and I had learned from somewhere that you could use these things as typewriters, I sat down by a terminal and somebody came along and taught me how to use it. It was a DEC [Digital Equipment Corporation] machine with the VAX/VMS operating system which had a very good text editor. So I learned to use that. It had formatting commands in the old-fashioned way, where if you wanted to add some formatting to your document you put a line-break, a full-stop, and a code into it. For example, if you wanted to italicise a word, it was a line break, a full stop, an ‘i’, the word; then new line etc. I also learned to use macros, and had my first experience of writing a log-in script which contained the command ‘log out’, so that I was logged out immediately as soon as I logged on! Very useful experience. That was my first experience with computers.",

They had acquired a microfilm copy of Wittgenstein’s writings. Finding things on a microfilm is difficult, so they got the idea that they should index entries to the microfilm by keywords. It turned out to be so hard for them to agree on keywords that they realised, “we might as well try and transcribe the parts we’re interested in”. And I was hired to transcribe Wittgenstein’s writings. At that time the transcription was done on a typewriter, and then it was OCR-read off site somewhere.

I never had any formal training but I was introduced to it by a colleague and then started trying to do things. In general I found that it was easy to learn these things if you knew exactly what you wanted to do. So, if you take formal training with many other students, you learn general stuff and you learn some specifics, but it’s not targeted directly to your own needs. I was very clear about exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to parse this encoding, I wanted to check errors, I wanted to be able to index and to do retrieval and all these things.

So then I had to earn my living as a computing consultant of sorts at the Norwegian Centre for Computing in the Humanities. There I did all sorts of things such as travelling around the world and preaching the holy gospel of optical storage media, which many people thought to be the future of computing etc. That turned out not to be the case, but anyhow. At the same time I was unhappy about the fate of the Norwegian Wittgenstein Project that I had been working on because we had, after all, produced a lot of material and because of the situation with copyright etc, not only could we not continue the work, we were not even allowed to give access to the work to anyone else. I thought it was just too bad. So I worked very hard on establishing a new project, called the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen.Footnote1 That project started in 1990, based on an understanding with the Wittgenstein Trustees\n\nWittgenstein had assigned the copyright to his writings to colleagues in Philosophy in England and Finland. We had an agreement with them, and the agreement allowed us to produce what was called a machine-readable version of the Wittgenstein Nachlass, Footnote2 and to publish it in electronic form, but very clearly not to produce anything in book form. And then we got support from the University of Bergen and worked on that for 10 years. We spent exactly 10 years transcribing and finishing all the 20,000 pages of Wittgenstein’s Nachlass and published them with Oxford University Press.Footnote3",

But it was a lot of work because, you know, this was 1990, the World Wide Web did not exist and SGML had just been established as an ISO standard a few years before. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) had just begun working and there were no published TEI guidelines. We, or I, decided not to use SGML for a number of reasons. So I decided on a code system or markup language (A Multi-Element Code System (MECS)) especially for this (see Huitfeldt 1994), which meant that I had to develop all the software and this was a lot of work.

        "utterance_text": "That was one factor. Another factor was very simply a trivial factor, namely that no software that I knew of at that time existed for doing the things that we wanted to do with the transcriptions that we produced. SGML was a very complex system, much more complex than XML (which of course, didn’t exist at all at that time). So it had to do with overlapping hierarchies and that kind of thing but it also had to do with the concern that I felt that developing software for SGML would be much more difficult than developing software for a system that I had designed myself and, you know, that I could adapt so I had it all in my own control, so to speak. That was also a reason. I think if I had started such a project today I would not have done it that way, I would have probably have used XML, but it was a very different situation. So we spent 10 years on this and then we published the entire collected works on CD at Oxford University Press. And I thought, by then, that this has been a very interesting and wonderful time. I was thankful that I had had the chance to do this work. But 15 years with Wittgenstein – it was time to do something else!\n\nBut the Wittgenstein Archive still exists, which is a little bit paradoxical, you might say. The whole reason for doing this work was to make the writings accessible so it would not be necessary for scholars to travel to see the originals in Cambridge, in the Austrian National Library and there are a couple of manuscripts in Canada as well, and now it is accessible electronically. But still people keep going to Bergen. I think it’s simply because it has become a centre for Wittgenstein research and people travel there to see people, other people.\n\nAlso I should say, if we had done this today, well even then, we wanted to make the source material freely available on the internet. But it was out of the question because the copyright holders did not want to let that happen. Because of the contract restraints it is still not possible although parts of the Nachlass is now available on the web.",

My interest – even after having worked with Wittgenstein for such a long time – was not primarily Wittgenstein’s Philosophy, it was the philosophical problems that could arise from aspects of the work that we were doing. I was interested in the problems of trying to represent a document in another form; the semantics of the whole operation; the kinds of cognitive processes that are involved and the criteria for judging etc; and the role of technology in relation to the written word.

And, of course, text is not the object of study in Philosophy, but what is it? Whatever it is it is transmitted through text. I mean Philosophy is a discipline which is performed almost entirely in language: you talk, you listen, you read, you write. That’s what you do as a philosopher. And then when faced with the fact that what they had been working with for years (a published edition of Wittgenstein’s writings) had a problematic status in relation to what Wittgenstein actually wrote, that it had been heavily edited, that editors had selected passages and suppressed others etc, that was something that was completely unknown to them. And it seemed to me that it didn’t concern most people and that there really was little interest. So that struck me as very paradoxical.\n\nBut then I found that this has to do with philosophical traditions too, mainly the English/American Analytic Philosophy which, to a large extent, is a systematic, problem-oriented discipline. The attitude is that the author is not of interest, it’s the problems. If what Wittgenstein wrote was in some details different from what is actually being published, well, we can look at it and see if it gives us some new and interesting philosophical ideas. But what we are working on is the basis of the published texts, that’s an independent object. Whereas the continental, especially the German tradition, historically had a lot of editorial works. So that made me aware of things I hadn’t known. That was useful. That is the role of text technology in Philosophy itself.",

It came into being because there were a few enthusiasts and some of them were very good at manoeuvring in the university. Yes, so I guess I have the same experience, you might say, but it’s never really struck me as a problem, in part because I have never really been able to relate to the idea of DH or Humanities Computing as some kind of discipline. I mean, it’s natural, in a way, to give practical help if you are using the same tools in your work. Perhaps also because DH has not been so established academically there is little of the kind of competition that you find within the established disciplines. You know, if you have a good idea about something then you’d better write it up, lock it up in your drawers and don’t mention it until you’ve got it published.

You know, that’s not in a way so surprising because there is always also the endless debate of what the Humanities are and the crisis of the Humanities etc. When you’ve been around for a while you get used to that. The crisis cannot be a crisis because it’s been going on for at least the 30 years that I have been in the Humanities. But at the same time, in the last few years there seems to be a larger emphasis not so much on the tools and methods, but on studies of ethical aspects and the consequences for society and culture of the introduction of new technology. I’m a little bit worried about that because, I mean, again it gives the Humanities a role in relation to technology as servants or as users. Very often, as soon as there is a question of involving Humanities in some kind of non-core Humanities activity we are set to look at the cultural consequences and the ethical aspects. Of course, as Humanists we can do that but we can do much more, we can contribute to the development of the technology itself and be there in the process of deciding what useful aims to work for etc are. I think that’s going in the wrong direction now. That worries me a little bit.",
