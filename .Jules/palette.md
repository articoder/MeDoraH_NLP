**Learning:** Landing pages often lack basic accessibility markers like meaningful titles and skip-to-content links, which are critical for screen reader and keyboard users even when the pages are part of a larger CMS.
**Action:** Always check for <title>, <h1>, and skip-to-content links when working on landing pages. Ensure generic links have descriptive aria-labels.
